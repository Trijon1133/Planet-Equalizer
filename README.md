Trithereum Global Platform

Ethereum Smart Contract Known as “The Planet Equalizer”
Trithereum.com -  Trithereum.Eth

How does it work?

First the Trithereum Global Platform issues a smart contract token for every sovereign citizen of the planet called a Tridentity Token that will track and record any and all contributions of a token holder in the form of labor, charity, or monetary contribution on the block-chain during their lifetimes. Trithereum Platform will replace the current Social Programs worldwide with one efficient program for all people. The Token holders will have a guaranteed (UBI) Universal Basic Income if not of working age, unable to work, or over 65 & not working. 

The Tridentity Tokens issued to an individual in the work force will only be required to work 6 or 4 hours per day while also providing the same monetary benefits of an 8 hr work day. 
This will give every global citizen a chance to not only participate & contribute to society but have more time to focus on the things the truly matter in life.  "Faith, Family, & Friends". 

Tridentity Platform will also provide a global platform for Government, Corporations, & private individuals to list projects to the smart contract that it needs completed & it will categorize them based on size, speed, & social impact of the project & match potential token holders to Trithereum Platform projects. 

The Trithereum Platform will then identify the special skills & talents of the people best suited for the project & the smart contract will execute a contribution call for the best suited individuals. The Trithereum Platform will also identify the industrial & environmental potential of each area of the planet & the resources it provides & match those with the governments, corporations, & private projects that are then uploaded to the platform. The increased efficiency of this platform will reduce the need for global labor costs by more than 50-60% giving more time off for the individual. With the increased adoption of automated technologies, robotics, nanotechnologies & smart contracts this will increase efficiency at the same time decreasing jobs in the labor force, hence the need for the Trithereum Global Platform to be created & adopted globally.
